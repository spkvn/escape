# Escape

A php script to pull data from MySQL db and create a JSON file. 
## Usage
```bash
cd /to/directory/
php -f main.php
```

##Notes
This previously just spat a database out as a json object. That's not at all what mongodb needs. I'm now working on a reliable way to figure out relationships of an RDBMS entity.
